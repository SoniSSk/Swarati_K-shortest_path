# Swarati_K-shortest_path
Our project Swarati is based on Floyd Warshall and Dikstra’s Algorithm. We are also providing different type of riding services like economy ride and luxury ride for more comfortable experiences Firstly,we are asking customers to sign up if they are new users for that we are receiving phone no,user name,password. Otherwise they will have to log in first for any types of services. Time complexity: For all pair shortest path we have used warshall’s  algorithm with complexity O(n^3) For shortest path we have used Dijkstra’s algo having complexity O(nlogv),where v is vertices.
